# React version
This is the reactjs version of the Agora dashboard.

# Setup
In order to get this running do the following:
- `cd React` 
- `npm install` to install all dependencies, incl. react, mocha, etc.
- `npm start` starts the dev server that logs out a url like `http://localhost:8080/` where you find the dev version

# Run tests
`npm test`

# For Production
Run `npm run-script build` which creates the file `React/build.js` that gets included in the `index.html`.
This build script creates one file, includes all deps and preprocesses react's JSX syntax.


All the best from #socrates14 :)
